- Himeji is a discord bot that I am currently developing. Hoping to make it big one day.

- If you find any issues within the code please submit a issue via this Repo's [Issue Page](https://github.com/Yat-o/HimejiBot/issues)

- HimejiBot Uses Python Version [3.8.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/) and [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)

# TODO
- C&C Cogs and perhaps bot.py
- Add Leveling System
- Currency System
- Perhaps Custom Reactions(regex based)
- Make this README look cool :c
