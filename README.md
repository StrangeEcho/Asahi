# Self-Hosting(LINUX ONLY)
**This guide is also mainly written for Ubuntu/Debian(More Distro Support coming soon**
* To start off make sure you have the base requirements: **Python3.7+(PIP Included) and Git**
### Basic Setup
* Clone the repository\
`git clone https://github.com/Yat-o/HimejiBot/`
* CD your way into the projects root directory\
`cd path/to/HimejiBot`
* Setup your Virtual Environment(Venv)
```shell
python3 -m pip install venv #install venv
python3 -m venv venv #initialize the venv for this project
source venv/bin/activate #activate it
```
* Next it is time to get install setuptools and wheel so packages dont fail to build
  ```shell
  pip3 install setuptools
  pip3 install wheel 
  ```
* After that you are set to now install the bot's requirements\
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt -U`
* Now rename the configexample.py and fill it out as needed
```shell
mv configexample.py config.py #CASE SENSITIVE
nano config.py #After filling it out. Save and exit with ctrl+x
```
* Now then if you did everything right you should now be able to run the bot\
Its as simple as `python3 main.py`
* Congrats you have the bot running ðŸ¥³
### Pm2 Setup
Alright so this process if also fairly easy. Just do all the steps in the Basic Setup but dont run the last step
* Make sure you have the one of these: **npm or yarn**
* Install PM2 if you don't already have it\
`npm install pm2 -g` or `yarn global add pm2`
* After installing PM2 you are ready to run the bot\
`pm2 start pm2.json`
* After that you can check on the bot with\
`pm2 logs Himeji`
### Systemd Setup
Alright this setup is for people who want to run the bot as a Systemd service. Just do everything in the Basic Setup excep the last step.
* First off make sure you have root or sudo access
* Create and edit the service's unit file\
  `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/himeji.service`
* Next you will arrive onto an empty file. Copy and paste this into it
```
