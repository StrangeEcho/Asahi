- Himeji is a discord bot that I am currently developing. Hoping to make it big one day.

- If you find any issues within the code please submit a issue via this Repo's [Issue Page](https://github.com/Yat-o/HimejiBot/issues)

- HimejiBot Uses Python Version [3.8.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/) and [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) Version 1.6.0a

# TODO
- C&C Cogs and perhaps bot.py
- Add Leveling System(I'm not too sure about this tbh)
- Currency System(meh)
- Rewrite Error Handler


# NOTES
- I've removed Fun commands using nekos.py. However, I will continue to use nekos.py for other commands. More than likely those commands will be NSFW
